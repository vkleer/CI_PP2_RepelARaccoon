        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You returned from your favorite cheese store and bought 5 delicious cheeses to nibble on.
            What you didn't know, is that there is a raccoon living in your backyard who had been waiting
            for a moment like this for ages! He spread the word, and soon all of his furry friends assembled 
            to try and steal your cheese! Can you repel them all and save your dairy dream from disaster?
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the game is to keep as much of your cheese as possible. You start out with 5 cheeses
            and can get a perfect score by repelling all of the raccoons, keeping all 5 of the cheeses.
        </p>

            <li>Pick a difficulty</li>
            <li>Click on a raccoon to repel them - they hate being clicked on!</li>
            <li>Try to repel them until the timer reaches 0</li>
            <li>Enjoy your cheese!</li>
